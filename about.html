            Hi! I'm Majongg from the Philippines!!I choose this topic so that we
            can acknowledge that therapy is still an option! If more people knew about this, more people can put words
            into action! In our society, some people think that our emotions is not valid and think is just an act but
            it is not.This website talks about spreading awareness about Online Therapy and will help you understand our
            situation in our society and to encourage others to prioritize their well-being and break the silence around
            mental health struggles. Everyone, you have the right for people to listen to what you think and feel.

        <p> Why this website is worth reading about is because I believe mental health is just as important as physical
            health, yet many people still hesitate to seek help due to stigma, lack of access, or limited resources.
            Online therapy provides a convenient and accessible way for individuals to connect with professionals,
            especially for those who live far from clinics or feel uncomfortable with face-to-face sessions. By
            promoting awareness, I hope to let people know that support is available, that it is okay to ask for help,
            and that seeking therapy is a sign of strength rather than weakness. This choice reflects my desire to
            encourage others to prioritize their well-being and break the silence around mental health struggles.
